# Telecom-Churn-Prediction

## Project Topic: Reducing churn by identifying high-risk customers for the Telecom industry

### About the Project:
A major telecom company's postpaid business of voice-only plans is struggling to maintain its strong foothold in the local market due to:

- High churn rate amongst customers leading to a revenue decline of ~500k USD every month.

- The decline in overall customer base (high churn rate combined with low acquisition rate), leading to a decline in total market share.

- The project focuses on applying predictive analytics and identifying the factors that impact customer churn.
